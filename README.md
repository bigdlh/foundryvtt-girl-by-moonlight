An attempt to adapt the Blades in the Dark system created by megastruktur to Girl by Monlight

## Clocks 
(thanks to TyrannosaurusRoy for permission to use the UI code from his great Clocks module!)

Clock Actors

Clock Actors live in your Actors tab (and can be dragged onto a scene as a token). To get started, create a new actor and select the clock actor type. Change a clock setting (such as theme or size) or hit the Reset button (between the plus/minus buttons) to generate the correct clock artwork, if it doesn't appear as expected.  Note that you can right-click Clock tokens for some of the same UI buttons from Clock Tiles for modifying the clock which will carry over to the linked actor.  Multiple clock tokens linked to the same actor should stay in sync within the same scene, but tokens in different scenes will have to have the sheet opened to sync up.

Clock Tiles

Clock Tiles are useful for quick, disposable clocks you'd like to drop onto the scene but don't plan to keep around for long. Click the new Clock button in the Tiles toolbar and a new clock will be dropped into the actual middle of your scene (you may need to scroll to see it). When you select and right-click the clock you'll see a new set of controls on the left that let you switch the clock's theme, cycle through clock sizes, and increment/decrement progress on the clock.

## Troubleshooting
- If you can't find an item added to your sheet, refer to "All Items" tab on each sheet.
